Seeed Wio E5 LoraWan BME680 node without seperate MCU.
Data from the BM680 is sent through the Helium LoraWan network to Cayenne to visualize the measured data

PCB designed with KiCad, assembled by seeedstudio (https://github.com/Seeed-Studio)

Next steps todo:
- testing low power consumption (low current measurement equipment needed like https://github.com/nfhw/tinycurrent)
- rework pcb to shrink it
- connection to Datacake instead of directly to Helium
